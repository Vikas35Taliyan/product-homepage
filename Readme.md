 # Product Homepage
In this Product Homepage project, I use HTML  paragraphs, headings, ids, and classes to target HTML elements effectively. In CSS I used flexbox for creating navbar positions to set an element in DOM. A big Thanks to Hitesh Choudhary sir and Ineuron who gave me the opportunity to learn and grow.
